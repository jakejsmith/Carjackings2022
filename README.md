# Carjackings2022
Analyzing America's carjacking spree and the extent to which young people were behind it.

# Data Sources
Data used in this analysis are incident-level crime data from city police departments, obtained from the following sources:
- Chicago, IL carjacking incident data
- New York, NY crime incident data[^1]
- Los Angeles, CA crime incident data
- Pittsburgh, PA crime incident data
- Denver, CO crime incident data
- Norfolk, VA crime incident data
- Chandler, AZ crime incident data

[^1]: In order to reduce file sizes, data from NYC were filtered to include only carjacking incidents prior to downloading.

Note: While full datasets were downloaded from Los Angeles, Chandler, Norfolk, Denver, and Pittsburgh, all non-carjackings were filtered out prior to upload, in order to accommodate GitHub file size constraints. However, the code should work perfectly fine with the full datasets for these five cities.
